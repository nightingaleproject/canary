## Canary EDRS Testing Framework

Canary is an open source testing framework that supports development of systems that perform standards based exchange of mortality data. Canary provides tests and tools to aid developers in implementing the Vital Records Death Reporting (VRDR) FHIR death record format (http://hl7.org/fhir/us/vrdr) Revision 4.

## Versions

    Releases v2.x.x of the Canary project supports FHIR STU3, in line with the May ballot version of VRDR (v0.1.0)
    Releases v3.x.x of the Canary project supports FHIR R4, in line with the upcoming normative version of VRDR.

If you are upgrading from 2.x.x to 3.x.x, please note that there are differences between FHIR STU3 and R4 that impact the structure of the VRDR Death Record. [This commit illustrates the differences between FHIR STU3 and FHIR R4 VRDR Death Records](https://github.com/nightingaleproject/vrdr-dotnet/commit/2b4c2026fdab80e7233f3a7d7ed6e17d5d63f38e). Death Record data may need similar updates from STU3 to R4 when updating to Canary Version 3.

Canary can test a data providers ability to:
- Produce FHIR Death Records
- Consume FHIR Death Records
- Roundtrip: Convert between FHIR (Consuming) and the IJE Mortality format (Producing)
- Roundtrip: Convert between the IJE Mortality format (Consuming) and FHIR (Producing)
- Produce predefined FHIR Death Records as tested at Connectathons
- Produce FHIR Messages
- Produce predefined FHIR Messages as tested at Connectathons

Canary also includes the following utilities:
- Generate Synthetic Death Records
- Validate FHIR Death Records
- Death Record Format Converter
- FHIR Death Record Inspector
- FHIR Death Record Creator
- IJE Mortality Record Inspector
- Validate FHIR Messages
- Create FHIR Messages

### Background

Mortality data is collected, analyzed, and shared by jurisdictions across the United States to provide insight into important trends in health, including the impact of chronic conditions, progress on reducing deaths due to motor vehicle accidents, and the evolving challenge of substance abuse. Numerous systems are used to collect and share information on decedents, including demographic data and medical information relevant to determining the cause of death. By connecting these systems using modern standards like FHIR we can implement processes that reduce the burden on certifiers, improve data quality, and improve timeliness of data collection and reporting. Canary supports the development of interoperable systems by providing tools for testing implementations and working with mortality data formats.

### Running

A [Dockerized](https://www.docker.com/get-started) version of Canary has been published to Docker Hub. To make sure you have the most recent version of Canary:

```
docker pull mitre/canary:latest
```

Running Canary is as easy as:

```
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 mitre/canary:latest
```

These commands will pull the latest version of Canary from Docker Hub, and run it. You can access it from a web browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). To run a specific version, simply append the version to the `docker run` command above. You can see all versions of Canary that are available to run from DockerHub [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/mitre/canary/tags). For example:

```
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 mitre/canary:3.0.0-RC2
```

If you want to build a Dockerized Canary from scratch (from source), you can do so by running (inside the project root directory):

```
docker build -t canary .
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name mycanary canary
```

If you prefer not to use Docker, you can run Canary from the root project directory using the version of [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) listed in [global.json](global.json) and an installation of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/):

```
dotnet --version # Verify this only returns a version and no error
node --version # Verify Node is successfully installed
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
dotnet ef database update --project canary
dotnet run --project canary
```

After you execute the `dotnet run` command, the application will be accessible from a web browser at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

### Publishing a Version

The primary method of deploying Canary is to DockerHub. Whenever a commit is merged into master, DockerHub will automatically build that commit and tag it as `latest` on DockerHub so any user that runs `docker pull mitre/canary:latest` will receive a copy of the image.

Whenever a tag is created on Canary of the form `vX.Y.Z`, Dockerhub will automatically build that git tag and and tag it as `X.Y.Z` on DockerHub. This means any user who runs `docker pull mitre/canary:X.Y.Z` will receive a copy of the application at version `X.Y.Z`.
